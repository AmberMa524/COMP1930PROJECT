This POS tablet is a victory of engineering! So sleek! So slippery! It's like it came from outer space! -Why, if you put it on a wooden chair seat, you might come back an hour later and find that it has fallen to the floor. Amazing! But how? Why, because the 1 degree of declination of the chair was enough for this frictionless Device From The Future to slide micron by micron over the course of many minutes until gravity snatched it away. Astounding! We pay extra for this!
<br>
But let's talk about my strange "Milking Cow" comment. What can I possibly mean?
<br>
Well, I would have liked to plug my frictionless Marvel from the Future into my existing dull and not-slippery computer from today, and I would like to, through the powerful USB C port, connect to the internet supplied by my computer. "Reverse Tethering" they call it. It has a name, because people desire the feature well enough to have provided it with one. -And at the same time, I would like to drag and drop files between the two machines. And at the same time, I would also like the battery to charge.
<br>
And why not? All of these desires ought to be (and are!) trivial challenges for the technology at hand! But does that mean the features exist?
<br>
No. You cannot Reverse Tether the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3.
<br>
At least not mine. I don't know why mine is different, because according to some reports, you CAN reverse tether it. Indeed, there are plenty of web sites out there whereupon asked, "How do I reverse tether my S3 to my computer's internet through USB?" and they will, (dozens of them!), tell me with great energy and self-satisfaction, which series of buttons to press and toggles to switch. -All of which any standard muppet could and should be able to figure out on his own. Since I am asking, since I am arriving confused at the digital doorstep of these founts of helpful information, perhaps I've already exhausted the obvious and need some ACTUAL help?
<br>
Because the option does not exist.
<br>
After days of misadventure involving rooting and flashing ROMS and playing around with command windows and USB tunneling all manner of half-baked "Apps", the conclusion I have reached and confirmed is that the feature has been deliberately crippled on the manufacturing side. You are not allowed to reverse tether your tablet. -You can use an annoying dongle and plug directly in an ethernet cable, but then you can't charge or share files. Is that inconvenient? Yes! Yes, it is.
<br>
Why would anybody want to actively prevent me from finding convenience with my device? Why prevent me from making an internet connection through my computer rather than using an expensive wireless data plan costing as much and sometimes in excess of $100 per month? Why? Who can say? Such workings of the world are perhaps beyond the feeble imaginations of the user base.
<br>
Look, Samsung, Verizon or whoever...
<br>
If you want me to pay a monthly fee to unlock basic features, then don't charge $600 for a device. It's not like with a car purchase, where extra features represent the installation and cost of real extra parts, like stereo systems or air conditioning units. The features I want in my tablet are already there, but have been switched off deep in the firmware precisely to frustrate me into simply saying, "Screw it! I shall pay!" -And even that cynical approach to creating scarcity would be (semi) fine, IF I wasn't paying a premium price for the device, essentially buying the opportunity to be turned into a subscriber.
<br>
ANYWAY...
<br>
This tablet is pretty good if you don't mind tablets. I personally can't stand tablets. Or smart phones in general. They make people stupid as they encourage the outsourcing of mental tasks which normally keep us sharp and smart, they turn people into dopamine hit addicts sliding down the screen hoping for the next set of cherries. They reduce people to twittering bird brains.
<br>
But as far as stupid, lousy, no-good manipulative population-dulling psychological warfare initiatives go, this one sure is super-shiney and can slide off a chair like something from science fiction!
<br>
Thumbs UP!

          <br>I'm a graduate student and I purchased this to replace my aging iPad 2. I read a lot of PDFs of papers during my train rides and downtime. The ability to write on PDFs as annotations, clip items using the Smart Select feature, and the split-screen capability (allowing me to read a paper in Mendeley at the top of the screen and take handwritten notes in OneNote at the bottom) have completely changed my workflow. I considered an iPad Pro at the same time as this, but I'm completely satisfied with the TabS3 and S-Pen. I have no complaints so far, and it has been able to do everything I asked of it. I added 64GB Micro-SD as additional storage, and picked up a Fintie case which is working great.

      <h5 style="text-align: left">REVIEW SUMMARY:</h5>  
      <p style="text-align: left">
      Looks: The tablet is sleek and elegant but it definitely needs a protecting case, without it it's like holding a slab of glass.
Performance: Pretty good so far, while i didn't install too many things yet, there is no perceivable slowness or chopping during transitions or movie playback.
Camera: Despite claiming higher resolution (13MP), the rear camera doesn't seem to be as good as the one in the edge 7 especially in low light. This might not be a big issue as using the tablet as a camera was never really convenient anyway, but had to be noted.
Extra features: The tablet comes with 4 speakers which i believe is fairly new to tablets, but there is not much base, the sound quality is just barely better than the S2. Samsung also added a stylus pen, personally i don't find these very useful and not being able to "dock" it, I'm sure I'll lose it very soon.
Connectivity: Standard WiFi a/n and Bluetooth 4, no issues there. Those who need cellular network connectivity will need to look at the SM-T825 model, this one is just WiFi.
Battery: It's early to judge but so far the 6000mah battery seems pretty good. From full charge in the morning it's only down to 54% after actively using the table all day.
