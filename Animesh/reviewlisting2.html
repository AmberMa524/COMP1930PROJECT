          <br> I've been using this for about a week now and so far it's great. While it's technically not a gaming laptop it 
          will handle most newer games at medium to high settings with decent frame rates. The screen has great color and brightness, 
          sound despite bottom facing speakers was louder than expected. The track-pad is responsive and snappy (no physical buttons) 
          >which might be a con to some. Battery life while watching netflix and surfing the web has been anywhere from 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 
          hours for me. I'm sure I could get more with some tweaking.
<br>
          I did have to order a mounting bracket and cable from Acer to attach my hdd (part # 42.GP4N2.SV1) that you can order from the Acer 
          website for $8 usd. Other reviews have mentioned you can call them and see if they'll send you one for free. I opted to forgo 
          the hassle and pay the 8 bucks.
<br>
          Pros: A lot of power packed into a $600 laptop. If you're not a hardcore gamer but still like to play games this might work 
          for you. It exceeded my expectations.
<br>
          Cons: (These are nit picky and subjective)
          <br>
          1. No cd drive but who uses those anymore anyway. If you do need one you can always plug a cheap usb one into it.
          <br>
          2. If you want to add a 2.5 hdd for storage you need to order the cable and bracket along with being comfortable 
          <br>opening up a brand new laptop. The Acer website has a guide with pictures on how to do it, though.
          <br>
          3. Plastic lid and aluminum palm rest show prints fairly easily. If you have ocd like me that might bother you but pretty minor.
<br>
          Over all very pleased with this purchase. You'd be hard pressed to find a laptop with 256g ssd, discrete graphics, i5 8250u
          <br>processor and ddr4 memory for the money. (At the time of this review) Will update this in the future should my opinion change.

          <br>This Laptop is pretty good, however, the description said that this had a backlit keyboard. I got the Core i5 GeForce MX150 version and there is NO backlit keyboard. Also for some reason, my laptop charger started to fail me, the connection would disconnect and I would have to keep the charging cable in angles to charge the laptop. Finally, idk if it's my internet, but sometimes the Wifi would disconnect and the Wifi setting would not show any networks available, it happened often. The laptop also gets hot if you play games on it so remember to keep it well ventilated. Mic is pretty good as well. Wifi is also pretty good as its super fast and great to play online games with since my brother's ps4 has issues with connectivity when I'm playing online.

      <h5 style="text-align: left">REVIEW SUMMARY:</h5>  
      <p style="text-align: left">
      I turned unit on and initiated Windows to check. This unit is a Christmas gift for my niece in the Philippines. 
      <br>So far no burned pixels or power issues detected. Will evaluate better when my niece uses it. Unit was delivered well packaged, 
      <br>and on time. Hats off for that.Laptop looked like new. Set up was easy. Iâ€™m very happy with this purchase
