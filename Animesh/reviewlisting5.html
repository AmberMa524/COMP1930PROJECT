Before deciding to purchase this, I watched and read many reviews online. The Surface Go has received so much hate and I just don't understand why. This isn't meant to be used as the main computer. However, it is perfect as a browsing and media machine.
<br>
The build quality on Surface products is nothing short of incredible. The body is all metal and is incredibly sturdy and exudes quality. The hinged stand which is a staple of Surface devices is nothing short of amazing. You can set it at any angle and it just works. It is incredibly secure and never slips. The only issues I have with the Go is the bezels (I wish they were a bit smaller), and only having one USB-C port. It would have been amazing to be able to charge the Go through one USB-C connection while I use the other for attaching devices. Yes, I know you can use the included charger which attaches to the expansion slot, but I find it so much easier to just charge though USB-C even if it is slightly slower. Not needing to bring a separate charger just for this computer and instead charge it with the same cable I would for my phone is so much more convenient.
<br>
As a computer, this works for browsing. I have personally taken it out of S-mode so I can install any Windows application on it I want. With 8GB of RAM and the 128GB SSD, the performance isn't bad at all. It isn't the most responsive when using Chrome on large web pages, but that is to be expected. Chrome is fairly resource intensive. On the other hand, using Edge it easily handles any page you can throw at it. Windows productivity software like Excel, Word, and Power Point work exactly as you would expect them to. Communication software works perfectly as well. One of the things I really like about the surface line is the face unlock. It does use an IR light so you won't have any issues unlocking it even in the dark. Doing so is incredibly fast and it pains me having to type in a password manually on my desktop computer. One thing I am unable to review is the Surface keyboard. If I need a keyboard I will just connect to one wirelessly through Bluetooth. The stylus is great though. It does fall short of something like a Wacom tablet but is usable for drawing and perfect for a mouse substitute.
<br>
For a media tablet this checks every box as well. I installed K-Lite Codec Pack on it and it has no issues playing anything I can throw at it. Even 50GB+ 4k movies with DTS audio streamed over the network from my server are no problem at all for this. Same with 4k YouTube videos. The speakers are quite surprising. They are loud, clear, provide a decent amount of bass, and are actually stereo. The screen is excellent quality with a great contrast ratio and vivid colors. The battery life when viewing media is also more than enough for a cross-country flight.
<br>
Now, the heart of the matter is value. The Surface Go isn't a cheap device. Yes, it is primarily a tablet. But it is also so much more. The build quality is on par with the new iPad Pro's. But the iPad is almost twice the price, has half the storage, and is running a mobile OS. You can do everything on this you can with a tablet, while still having the flexibility of a full computer. To me, this is a win-win situation. The intended customer for this isn't someone looking for a $250 Android tablet. The customer who should be getting this will mostly be using it as a tablet, while still wanting the option to use it as a full computer when they are on the go. For that, the Surface Go is perfect

          <br>Nice machine. I bought this to take notes in class with and to use as an accessory to my main laptop for school work.
<br>
The restricted version of Microsoft it comes with would be frustrating to some I could imagine. Makes it impossible to use google chrome as a browser (forced to use edge) and can’t download 3rd party apps. If you plan to use this tablet to draw/design/edit images make sure there is appropriate software to do so. I was pretty disappointed that I can’t download GIMP but it isn’t mandatory for my use.

      <h5 style="text-align: left">REVIEW SUMMARY:</h5>  
      <p style="text-align: left">
      The only thing that made this Amazon warehouse deal "Used" was the box was a little scuffed... But the box goes in a closet or you chuck it and use the Surface Go. Saved me like $50, everything was flawless, without scuffs/scratches or dents and had all the accessories. The only odd thing I noticed is the Surface Go came with Windows 10 home enabled so I am guessing the person who returned it turned off S mode and it didn't perform for a specific program or something. For me I don't care because I planned on turning S mode off anyways.
<br>
To be clear though the listing did state there was less than 5% cosmetic damage on all metrics and did disclose that all accessories were included. BE MINDFUL to check this section and see if everything is present. Mine listed it all was, and indeed it all was.
