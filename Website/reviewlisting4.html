          I purchased this mini for travelling. It came with a charger for a phone; furthermore the charger was not an Apple product. I hope Amazon rectifies this for me! I was unable to access my home wifi to set it up so went to the Apple store. They were unable to get it going either although they could access their wifi. I had to return two days later with an appointment with a technician who successfully did diagnostic tests and got the iPad up and running. Now, hopefully, I am set up for future. So, it was a fair amount of trouble, and the phone charger is very slow to charge the iPad. All that said, it looks fairly good, almost like new, and I’m starting to enjoy it and appreciate the low price relative to buying a new one. I am finding that the charge doesn’t hold that well so far.

          <br>My wife had dropped our iPad Mini 1, destroying the screen. I replaced that screen, and 6 mths later, my daughter pushed too hard on the home button and cracked the LCD!.
<br>
Took a look around for a replacement LCD, and for $70 I could replace it myself. Did a little more research and found this iPad Mini 4 for a very reasonable price, and reviews were positive for the refurb.
<br>
Unit arrived within 2 days and so far I'm super impressed. Battery life is good. Screen has very minor hairline scratches that I cannot see when the screen is on, and the body also has a few very tiny dings on the edges. Overall it's in a 9/10 condition, for half what Apple sells their certified refurbs for. Pretty happy for the price!

      <h5 style="text-align: left">REVIEW SUMMARY:</h5>  
      <p style="text-align: left">
      This iPad had scratches all over the back of it, it DIES the second the power source is unplugged no matter if it says it’s 100% charged. The transformer box for the wall was no certified Apple, neither is the lighting cord that came with the iPad. They look like gas station cables and they don’t work very well either.<br>
The iPad came in a box, no bubble wrap nothing, and then the box the iPad was tossed into was then tossed into a larger Amazon Box, again with no bubble wrap or anything to cushion the constantly movement within the boxes. I’m surprised this iPad made it as far as it did in one piece. I would not recommend buying.
